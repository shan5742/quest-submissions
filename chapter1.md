# Chapter 1

### Day 1

#### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

A blockchain is a distributed database. Blockchains collect information in groups, which are known as blocks. Blocks have a certain capacity and once reached are connected to the previous block - forming a chain of data.
  
#### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.
  
Smart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain which users can interact with. Smart contracts are transparent, efficient and thuis can be used in good faith without the need for an intemediatory. 
  
#### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
  
A transaction is essentilly a paid function call. Whenever data is going to be changed on the blockchain we must pay a gas fee for this function/change to be successful.
    
A script on the other hand is a way we can read data from the blockchain, this data cannot be updated, deleted or changed in any way. Scripts do not have any associated fee with them.

### Day 2

#### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Safety & Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming


#### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

- Safety & Security

  A lot of blockchains promise and possible use case is in the financial space, whenever $$$ is involved safety and security is paramount. Without it people can lose money, get scammed and the whole idea behind decentralised and trustless falls down. As with most things in life, reputation is super important and if programs on the blockchain weer not safe and secure that reputation would be tarnished and we could never see mass adoption.
  
- Clarity

  Having readable code has so many benefits. Firstly it means that those interacting with the contract who don't necessarily have any programming knowledge can still probably get a rough idea of what it is doing and feel confident in using it. Also, if code is well written and readable it does not need to come with massive explainers, new devs can come along and pickup the project seamlessly without having a massive amount of onboarding time.
  
- Approachability

  Having lots of other crossover with other programming languages gives cadence the best possible chance to attract new developers to the space. More ecperienced developers leads to more growth and innovation. If on the other hand cadence was super difficult to learn and different to a lot of other programming languages the dev pool would be small and projects would struggle to bet built.
  
- Developer Experience

  Similar to the above, a solid developer experience will help with bringing people to the language. On top of that having clear error messages and debugging patterns alloes users to develop and iterate quickly. Finally, having very clear, human readable errors makes it much easier to update the user from a UX standpoint.
